# AllApp
A decentralized, ethical platform for work, collaboration, services, and civic life.

🧱 FOUNDATION & PHILOSOPHY
Pillar	Description
✅ Verified Identity + Civic Awareness	Users must pass ID + photo check to become basic members. Full access is granted only after completing a Civic Awareness Test, ensuring basic understanding of social respect and community duties.
🔐 Privacy by Default	All user data is private and user-controlled. Every month, users are prompted to verify the relevance of their stored data. If not confirmed, it is auto-deleted unless another verified user opts to take responsibility, gaining trust points and certifications.
🚫 No Ads or Boosted Content	Visibility is based purely on merit, trust, quality, and relevance — not money.
🪙 Effort-Based Economy	Powered by Copin, a currency tied to time and contribution — not speculation or fiat market forces.
🌱 Minimal, Transparent Monetization	The platform is sustained by a 1% fee on each transaction or withdrawal — no hidden costs, no investor pressure.
🗂️ Sector-Based Structure	Everything is organized into real-world industries for discoverability, relevance, and meaningful collaboration.
